Personal Portfolio Website
--------------------------

A place to show my various projects, the website itself was done in bootstrap with a custom design. 
Additionally there is a custom javascript slider I created while brushing up on Jquery. 
The JS slider is set show three images at once but can be formatted to any number. 
If you are looking for a lightweight slider to show multiple images/divs at once this might be useful :)
